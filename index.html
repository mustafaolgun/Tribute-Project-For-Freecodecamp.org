            <h2>Short Brief About Keanu Charles Reeves</h2>
            <p>Keanu Charles Reeves (Born September 2, 1964) is a Canadian actor. Born in Beirut and raised in Toronto, Reeves began acting in theatre productions and in television films before making his feature film debut in Youngblood (1986). He had his breakthrough role in the science fiction comedy Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), and he reprised his role in its sequels. He gained praise for playing a hustler in the independent drama My Own Private Idaho (1991), and established himself as an action hero with leading roles in Point Break (1991) and Speed (1994).
            <br>
            <br>
            Following several box office failures, Reeves's performance in the horror film The Devil's Advocate (1997) was well received. Greater stardom came for playing Neo in the science fiction series The Matrix, beginning in 1999. He played John Constantine in Constantine (2005) and starred in the romantic drama The Lake House (2006), the science fiction thriller The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008), and the crime thriller Street Kings (2008). Following a setback, Reeves made a comeback by playing the titular assassin in the John Wick film series, beginning in 2014.
            <br>

                <h3>The Matrix Trilogy</h3>
                <p>
                    Computer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias "Neo", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase "the Matrix". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents attempt to coerce Neo into helping them locate Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses, the Agents fuse his mouth shut and implant a robotic "bug" in his stomach. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo, indicating that the "nightmare" he experienced was apparently real.

                <h3>The Devil's Advocate</h3>
                <p>
                    Kevin Lomax is a Gainesville, Florida defense attorney who has never lost a case. As he defends schoolteacher Lloyd Gettys against a charge of child molestation, he belatedly realizes his client is guilty. However, through a harsh cross-examination, Kevin destroys the victim's credibility, securing a "not guilty" verdict.
                    A representative of a New York City law firm asks Kevin to assist a jury selection. After the jury delivers a not guilty verdict, the head of the firm, John Milton, offers Kevin a high-paying job. Kevin accepts, and he and his wife Mary Ann move to Manhattan. He is soon spending most of his time at work, leaving Mary Ann feeling isolated. Kevin's fundamentalist mother, Alice, visits New York City and suggests they both return home after an unsettling conversation with Milton, but Kevin refuses.

                    Nelson Moss meets Sara Deever, a woman very different from anyone he has met before. His ignorance leads to her failing her driving test.

                <p>
                    LAPD SWAT officers Jack Traven and Harry Temple thwart an attempt to hold an elevator filled with passengers for a $3 million ransom by an extortionist bomber, but as they corner the man in an elevator, he takes Harry hostage. Jack intentionally shoots Harry in the leg, forcing the bomber to release him. The bomber flees and activates a bomb which was strapped to himself, seemingly dying in the process. Jack and Harry are praised by Lieutenant "Mac" McMahon, with Harry being promoted to detective. Having survived the incident, however, the bomber watches the ceremony on TV from an unknown location.
